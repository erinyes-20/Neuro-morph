# Neuro-morph

## Project Aims:

**Spiking neural networks**
- To understand the nature of spiking neural networks
- Implement Feed-forward and Convolutional spiking neural networks with surrogate gradients and test their classification performance on EMNIST dataset.
- Understand SNN input encoding via rate coding, latency coding and delta modulation
- Demonstrate the dead-neuron problem and examine training approaches like shadow training and spike-time gradient

**In-memory compute**
- Develop familiarity with IBM’s aihwkit by training an AnalogSequential model on ReRam and Capacitor Preset devices
